# Neural Machine Translation (NMT) using Transformer Architecture

## 1. Problem Definition & Objective
**Objective:** To develop a deep learning-based Neural Machine Translation system capable of translating text between two languages (German to English) with high semantic accuracy.

**Selected Project Track:** Natural Language Processing (NLP) / Deep Learning

**Problem Statement:**
Language barriers remain a significant obstacle in global communication, commerce, and education. Traditional Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems often lack the ability to capture long-range dependencies and context, resulting in literal but grammatically incorrect translations. This project aims to solve this by implementing a **Transformer-based NMT model**, which utilizes self-attention mechanisms to understand context better than recurrent models (RNNs/LSTMs).

**Real-world Relevance:**
* **Globalization:** Enabling real-time communication in international business.
* **Accessibility:** Making educational content available in low-resource languages.
* **Crisis Response:** aiding aid workers in communicating with locals during foreign disasters.
